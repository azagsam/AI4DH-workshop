        "# Introduction to Large Language Models (LLMs)\n",
        "\n",
        "Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing (NLP) and have become foundational tools in various AI applications. These models, trained on massive datasets, are capable of generating human-like text, translating languages, summarizing documents, answering questions, and much more. In this notebook, we will explore how to use large language models, particularly those built on architectures like GPT, BERT, and LLaMA.\n",
        "\n",
        "## What Are Large Language Models?\n",
        "\n",
        "LLMs are a type of deep learning model specifically designed to understand and generate text. They are typically based on transformer architectures, which allow them to process and generate text in parallel, making them highly efficient and powerful. The \"large\" in LLMs refers to the vast number of parameters—often in the billions—these models possess, which enables them to capture the nuances and complexities of human language.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Features of LLMs:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Contextual Understanding:** LLMs can generate text that is contextually relevant, meaning they understand the context in which words are used, leading to more accurate and coherent outputs.\n",
        "- **Transfer Learning:** These models can be fine-tuned on specific tasks with smaller datasets, making them highly versatile for various NLP applications.\n",
        "- **Generative Capabilities:** Beyond understanding text, LLMs can generate creative and complex content, from poetry to technical explanations.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Why Use LLMs?\n",
        "\n",
        "The widespread adoption of LLMs is driven by their ability to perform a wide range of tasks with minimal human intervention. They are used in chatbots, content creation, sentiment analysis, language translation, code generation, and more. Their ability to generalize across tasks without needing task-specific models has made them invaluable in both industry and research.\n",
        "\n",
        "## What Will You Learn?\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, you will learn how to leverage open-source LLMs for text generation and other NLP tasks using Python and popular libraries such as `transformers`. We will guide you through:\n",
        "- Setting up the environment for working with LLMs.\n",
        "- Loading pre-trained models and tokenizers.\n",
        "- Generating text based on specific prompts.\n",
        "\n",
        "By the end of this notebook, you will have a solid understanding of how to implement and use LLMs in practical scenarios, opening the door to countless AI-powered applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let’s get started!\n"

The gentle breeze rustled through the trees, and the occasional chirping of birds added a serene melody to the surroundings. Just as I was admiring the picturesque scenery, I noticed a commotion down the block. Curiosity piqued, I decided to investigate.\n",

It marks the first loss of its kind since the planes were delivered earlier this month.The cause of the crash was not a direct result of an enemy missile strike, the Ukrainian military claims.It said the pilot destroyed three cruise missiles and one drone in Russia's largest aerial attack to date.Ukraine receives first F-16 fighter jets\"Oleksiy saved Ukrainians from deadly Russian missiles,\" the Ukrainian Air Force wrote in a statement on social media.\"Unfortunately, at the cost of his own life.\"The statement did not specify the type of plane involved, but a military source told the BBC the pilot was flying an F-16.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky officially confirmed on Tuesday the US-made F-16s were being deployed to shoot down Russian drones and missiles.This week, he asked allies to allow Ukraine to use long-range missiles to hit targets further into Russia.Dutch Chief of Defence Gen Onno Eichelsheim confirmed the Netherlands will provide Ukraine with 24 of the jets, in addition to more weapons. There will be no restrictions on their usage apart from complying with humanitarian law, he told a conference in Washington on Wednesday - meaning Kyiv could launch deeper strikes into Russian territory. Around 65 F-16s have been pledged by Nato countries since US President Joe Biden first authorised willing European allies to send them to Ukraine in August 2023.Ukraine's F-16s work alongside a limited number of Western-supplied surface-to-air missile systems such as Patriot and Nasams which are already on the ground.They also help defend against Russian glide bombs - dumb munitions fitted with pop-out wing kits and guidance modules to deliver precision strike stand-off capabilities, similar to the JDAM munitions from the United States.The  destruction of the aircraft is a blow to President Zelensky, who said he will deliver a \"victory plan\" to US President Joe Biden next month.He also revealed Ukraine had recently carried out the first successful test of a domestically-produced ballistic missile, but declined to share any more details.Massive Russian strikes hit Ukraine for second daySeven killed in 'most massive' Russian air attack, Ukraine saysEuropeWar in UkraineMilitaryUkraineRelated'They look hideous' - Battle over the Irish flag on Dublin streetsStaff strike forces Louvre to close doors to visitorsOne million households without power in Ukraine after Russia attacks energy gridMore from the BBC2 hrs agoBriton who fought in Ukraine jailed for 13 years by RussiaFormer British soldier Hayden Davies, labelled a mercenary by Russia, will be sent to a maximum-security prison.2 hrs ago2 hrs agoUkraine in maps: Tracking the war with RussiaHow Russia's gradual gains in the face of fierce Ukrainian opposition have affected the front line in recent months.2 hrs ago4 hrs agoZelensky gives stark warning as EU leaders start crunch talks on Russia's frozen assetsThe leaders are deciding whether to loan tens of billions of euros in frozen Russian assets to fund Ukraine's military and economic needs.4 hrs ago15 hrs agoIn this secret missile factory, Ukraine is ramping up its domestic arms industryThe BBC goes to a secret Ukrainian factory, where they are manufacturing new long-range missiles. 15 hrs ago18 hrs agoBritish soldier killed in Ukraine told family to 'be proud' in letterThe body of Lance Corporal George Hooley, 28, has been repatriated to the UK after his death last week.18 hrs agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesThe BBC is in multiple languagesRead the BBC In your own languageOduu Afaan OromootiinAmharic ዜና በአማርኛArabic عربيAzeri AZƏRBAYCANBangla বাংলাBurmese မြန်မာChinese 中文网Dari دریFrench AFRIQUEHausa HAUSAHindi हिन्दीGaelic NAIDHEACHDANGujarati ગુજરાતીમાં સમાચારIgbo AKỤKỌ N’IGBOIndonesian INDONESIAJapanese 日本語Kinyarwanda GAHUZAKirundi KIRUNDIKorean 한국어Kyrgyz КыргызMarathi मराठीNepali नेपालीNoticias para hispanoparlantesPashto پښتوPersian فارسیPidginPolish PO POLSKUPortuguese BRASILPunjabi ਪੰਜਾਬੀ ਖ਼ਬਰਾਂRussian НА РУССКОМSerbian  NA SRPSKOMSinhala සිංහලSomali SOMALISwahili  HABARI KWA KISWAHILITamil தமிழில் செய்திகள்Telugu తెలుగు వార్తలుThai ข่าวภาษาไทยTigrinya ዜና ብትግርኛTurkish TÜRKÇEUkrainian УКРАЇНСЬКAUrdu اردوUzbek O'ZBEKVietnamese TIẾNG VIỆTWelsh NEWYDDIONYoruba  ÌRÒYÌN NÍ YORÙBÁFollow BBC on:Terms of UseSubscription TermsAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
