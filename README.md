# AI4DH: Workshop for Digital Humanities

This workshop provides a practical introduction to large language models (LLMs) for Digital Humanities researchers who already have basic Python experience and want to understand how modern AI tools can be applied in research settings. The focus is on hands-on experimentation, enabling participants to work with both open-source and commercial LLMs.

## Navigating the repository
The repository contains the following notebooks:  

- `exercises.ipynb` contains exercises for individual work. 

- `llm_machine_translation.ipynb` notebook provides a hands-on introduction to using large language models for machine translation and text generation, with a focus on practical experimentation. It also demonstrates how you can improve baseline results using RAG approach. 

- `openai-api.ipynb` introduces the practical use of commercial large language models via the OpenAI API. It demonstrates how to authenticate with an API key, send prompts to a hosted LLM, and handle model responses for typical NLP tasks such as text generation. 

- `llm-sentiment-classification.ipynb` demonstrates how large language models can be used for sentiment classification and also introduces the concept of guided decoding.

- `faster-inference-vllm.ipynb` shows how you can speed the inference using advanced inference libraries.
