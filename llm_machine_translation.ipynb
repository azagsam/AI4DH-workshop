        "# Introduction to Large Language Models (LLMs)\n",
        "\n",
        "Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing (NLP) and have become foundational tools in various AI applications. These models, trained on massive datasets, are capable of generating human-like text, translating languages, summarizing documents, answering questions, and much more. In this notebook, we will explore how to use large language models, particularly those built on architectures like GPT, BERT, and LLaMA.\n",
        "\n",
        "## What Are Large Language Models?\n",
        "\n",
        "LLMs are a type of deep learning model specifically designed to understand and generate text. They are typically based on transformer architectures, which allow them to process and generate text in parallel, making them highly efficient and powerful. The \"large\" in LLMs refers to the vast number of parameters—often in the billions—these models possess, which enables them to capture the nuances and complexities of human language.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Features of LLMs:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Contextual Understanding:** LLMs can generate text that is contextually relevant, meaning they understand the context in which words are used, leading to more accurate and coherent outputs.\n",
        "- **Transfer Learning:** These models can be fine-tuned on specific tasks with smaller datasets, making them highly versatile for various NLP applications.\n",
        "- **Generative Capabilities:** Beyond understanding text, LLMs can generate creative and complex content, from poetry to technical explanations.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Why Use LLMs?\n",
        "\n",
        "The widespread adoption of LLMs is driven by their ability to perform a wide range of tasks with minimal human intervention. They are used in chatbots, content creation, sentiment analysis, language translation, code generation, and more. Their ability to generalize across tasks without needing task-specific models has made them invaluable in both industry and research.\n",
        "\n",
        "## What Will You Learn?\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, you will learn how to leverage open-source LLMs for text generation and other NLP tasks using Python and popular libraries such as `transformers`. We will guide you through:\n",
        "- Setting up the environment for working with LLMs.\n",
        "- Loading pre-trained models and tokenizers.\n",
        "- Generating text based on specific prompts.\n",
        "\n",
        "By the end of this notebook, you will have a solid understanding of how to implement and use LLMs in practical scenarios, opening the door to countless AI-powered applications.\n",
        "\n",

From the user’s perspective, it behaves like a simple “ask a question, get an answer” interface.

These numbers are what the neural network actually operates on.\n",

        "At **low temperature**, the model strongly favors the highest-probability next token at each step. This results in translations that are stable, literal, and repeatable. You will often see very similar or even identical translations across multiple runs, with conservative word choices and standard phrasing. This setting is generally preferred for production or evaluation scenarios where faithfulness, consistency, and minimal paraphrasing are important.\n",

        "As the **temperature increases**, the model begins to sample from a wider range of plausible tokens. In translation, this can introduce paraphrasing, alternative sentence structures, or stylistic variation. While this may produce translations that sound more natural or expressive in some cases, it also increases the risk of drift—for example, slightly altered meaning, unnecessary rewording, or added/omitted nuances that were not present in the source text.\n",
        "\n",
        "At **very high temperatures**, translation quality typically degrades. The model may choose unusual or low-probability words, repeat phrases, or introduce factual or semantic errors. For translation specifically, this is undesirable because the task prioritizes semantic equivalence over creativity."

        "\n",
        "When the context is **short or vague** (e.g., after “The”), probability is spread across many plausible words (“dog,” “car,” “woman,” etc.). In this case, the top-k set may capture only part of the total probability mass. As the context becomes **more specific** (e.g., “The car”), probability concentrates on a few highly likely words (“drives,” “is”), and the top-k candidates cover almost all reasonable continuations.\n",

        "A **small k** makes the model more conservative and predictable, because it can choose only from a few high-probability words.

        "\n",

It marks the first loss of its kind since the planes were delivered earlier this month.The cause of the crash was not a direct result of an enemy missile strike, the Ukrainian military claims.It said the pilot destroyed three cruise missiles and one drone in Russia's largest aerial attack to date.Ukraine receives first F-16 fighter jets\"Oleksiy saved Ukrainians from deadly Russian missiles,\" the Ukrainian Air Force wrote in a statement on social media.\"Unfortunately, at the cost of his own life.\"The statement did not specify the type of plane involved, but a military source told the BBC the pilot was flying an F-16.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky officially confirmed on Tuesday the US-made F-16s were being deployed to shoot down Russian drones and missiles.This week, he asked allies to allow Ukraine to use long-range missiles to hit targets further into Russia.Dutch Chief of Defence Gen Onno Eichelsheim confirmed the Netherlands will provide Ukraine with 24 of the jets, in addition to more weapons. There will be no restrictions on their usage apart from complying with humanitarian law, he told a conference in Washington on Wednesday - meaning Kyiv could launch deeper strikes into Russian territory. Around 65 F-16s have been pledged by Nato countries since US President Joe Biden first authorised willing European allies to send them to Ukraine in August 2023.Ukraine's F-16s work alongside a limited number of Western-supplied surface-to-air missile systems such as Patriot and Nasams which are already on the ground.They also help defend against Russian glide bombs - dumb munitions fitted with pop-out wing kits and guidance modules to deliver precision strike stand-off capabilities, similar to the JDAM munitions from the United States.The  destruction of the aircraft is a blow to President Zelensky, who said he will deliver a \"victory plan\" to US President Joe Biden next month.He also revealed Ukraine had recently carried out the first successful test of a domestically-produced ballistic missile, but declined to share any more details.Massive Russian strikes hit Ukraine for second daySeven killed in 'most massive' Russian air attack, Ukraine saysEuropeWar in UkraineMilitaryUkraineRelatedTourists to face €2 fee to get near Rome's Trevi FountainPutin tells BBC Western leaders deceived RussiaNorway's crown princess likely needs lung transplant, palace saysMore from the BBC3 hrs agoMarking another Christmas far from homeA group of Ukrainian performers tell the story of what it is like to be far from home at Christmas.3 hrs ago5 hrs agoUS and Ukraine call Miami talks productive despite no breakthroughDonald Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, issued a statement with the top Ukrainian negotiator after discussing the latest peace plans.5 hrs ago2 days agoSteve Rosenberg: Was Putin's response to my question about war in Europe an olive branch?Russia's leader told our Russia editor that claims an attack on Europe was planned were \"rubbish\".2 days ago3 days agoPutin vows no more wars if West treats Russia with respectRussia's leader said during a TV marathon that claims that an attack on Europe was planned were \"nonsense\".3 days ago3 days agoUkraine in maps: Tracking the war with RussiaHow Russia's gradual gains in the face of fierce Ukrainian opposition have affected the front line in recent months.3 days agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveDocumentariesWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesThe BBC is in multiple languagesRead the BBC In your own languageOduu Afaan OromootiinAmharic ዜና በአማርኛArabic عربيAzeri AZƏRBAYCANBangla বাংলাBurmese မြန်မာChinese 中文网Dari دریFrench AFRIQUEHausa HAUSAHindi हिन्दीGaelic NAIDHEACHDANGujarati ગુજરાતીમાં સમાચારIgbo AKỤKỌ N’IGBOIndonesian INDONESIAJapanese 日本語Kinyarwanda GAHUZAKirundi KIRUNDIKorean 한국어Kyrgyz КыргызMarathi मराठीNepali नेपालीNoticias para hispanoparlantesPashto پښتوPersian فارسیPidginPolish PO POLSKUPortuguese BRASILPunjabi ਪੰਜਾਬੀ ਖ਼ਬਰਾਂRussian НА РУССКОМSerbian  NA SRPSKOMSinhala සිංහලSomali SOMALISwahili  HABARI KWA KISWAHILITamil தமிழில் செய்திகள்Telugu తెలుగు వార్తలుThai ข่าวภาษาไทยTigrinya ዜና ብትግርኛTurkish TÜRKÇEUkrainian УКРАЇНСЬКAUrdu اردوUzbek O'ZBEKVietnamese TIẾNG VIỆTWelsh NEWYDDIONYoruba  ÌRÒYÌN NÍ YORÙBÁFollow BBC on:Terms of UseSubscription TermsAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
